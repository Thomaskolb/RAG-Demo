Narodnaya Volya, a 19th-century terrorist group that killed tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1881 and developed the concept of propaganda by the deed, is a major influence. According to Sarah Brockhoff, Tim Krieger and Daniel Meierrieks, while left-wing terrorism is ideologically motivated, nationalist-separatist terrorism is ethnically motivated. They argue that the revolutionary goal of left-wing terrorism is non-negotiable, whereas nationalist terrorists are willing to make concessions. They suggest that rigidity of the demands of left-wing terrorists may explain their lack of support relative to nationalist groups. Nevertheless, many on the revolutionary left have showed solidarity for national liberation groups employing terrorism, such as Irish nationalists, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the South American Tupamaros, seeing them as engaged in a global struggle against capitalism. Since nationalist sentiment is fueled by socio-economic conditions, some separatist movements, including the Basque ETA, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Irish National Liberation Army incorporated communist and socialist ideology into their policies.'},\n",

The softness of linoleum prevented the cutting of fine lines, resulting in the bold shapes seen in Andrews works. Alternately, Andrews often applied a technique of repetitive hatch-marks in order to create the impression of texture. Flight's most technical achievement to the medium was abandoning the key-block, forcing his students to create structure with color.

The Southern Taurids originated from Comet Encke, while the Northern Taurids originated from the asteroid 2004 TG10. They are named after their radiant point in the constellation Taurus, where they are seen to come from in the sky. Because of their occurrence in late October and early November, they are also called Halloween fireballs. Encke and the Taurids are believed to be remnants of a much larger comet, which has disintegrated over the past 20,000 to 30,000 years, breaking into several pieces and releasing material by normal cometary activity or perhaps occasionally by close encounters with the tidal force of Earth or other planets (Whipple, 1940; Klačka, 1999). In total, this stream of matter is the largest in the inner solar system. Since the meteor stream is rather spread out in space, Earth takes several weeks to pass through it, causing an extended period of meteor activity, compared with the much smaller periods of activity in other showers. The Taurids are also made up of weightier material, pebbles instead of dust grains.'},\n",

Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, made a campaign stop for Gooden's behalf in Forney in Kaufman County, a month before the primary election. Accompanying Straus to Forney was State Senator Bob Deuell, who lost his own seat in the subsequent May 27 runoff election to the Tea Party movement choice, Bob Hall. In 2016, however, Gooden staged a successful comeback and unseated Spitzer in the March 1 Republican primary, 14,500 votes (51.8 percent) to 13,502 (48.2 percent). He returned to the state House in January 2017. In 2018, he won the Republican nomination for the 5th congressional district and was elected to that office on November 6, 2018, upon receiving 62.7 percent of the votes.\"},\n",

With regular captain Michael Thwaite suspended, club owner Clive Palmer named Cooper captain for the match against Melbourne Heart as a sign of the club\\'s commitment to promoting young players. Coach Miron Bleiberg subsequently described the move as a symbolic one, claiming that more experienced players would effectively lead the side on the field. Palmer suspended Bleiberg from his role as a result of those comments, replacing him with assistant coach Mike Mulvey for the Heart match. Gold Coast lost the game 1–0 to a late goal from Eli Babalj. Bleiberg quit the club days later, saying that Palmer\\'s actions had hurt his dignity. In Gold Coast\\'s next game, Cooper scored his first goal for the club, the side\\'s third in a 3–3 draw with Central Coast Mariners. He described this as a \"dream\" start, saying that he had previously been focused on the National Youth League and that he had tried to ignore the controversy surrounding his debut captaincy.

His elegy La pauvre fille appeared in 1814, and two successful tragedies produced in 1822, Clytemnestre and Saül, secured his admission to the Academy in 1824. Jeanne d'Arc (1825) was his most critically acclaimed play. Elisabeth de France (1828) was a weak imitation of Schiller's Don Carlos, But Soumet's real bent was towards epic poetry. A poem inspired by Klopstock, La divine épopée, describes the descent of Christ into Hades. Soumet's Norma, ou L'infanticide (Norma, or The Infanticide) was adapted by Vincenzo Bellini into the well-known opera Norma. Under Louis XVIII Soumet became librarian of Saint-Cloud, and subsequently was transferred to Rambouillet and to Compiègne. He died leaving an unfinished epic on Jeanne d'Arc.

Raised in a monarchic family, he first joined a political party : the Mouvement Socialiste Monarchique when he was about 15, but he quickly gave up monarchism and became closer to anarchism, and, then, to communists, but he got fed up with their stalinism. He moved to Nice and created the Occitan Nationalist Party there. From 1962, Fontan often met professor Guy Héraud and developed the first clarification of the linguistic border between Occitan and Piemontais. He died in Cuneo. He argues that states must create new borders, uniting each separate people within one country. In Africa especially, borders were created by European administrators and are not related to the various peoples. Creating new ethno-linguistic borders could avoid new massacres such as the one in Rwanda in 1994 between Tutsis and Hutus. He wrote some books, explaining his ideas. Ethnisme is the most known.'},\n",

In 1909, an earthquake destroyed the second floor, and the bastide had to be partly rebuilt. In 1969, he planted the first Cabernet Sauvignon on the estate.
